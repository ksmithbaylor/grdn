# Garden - a place for your seeds

This tool stores seed phrases in a local directory (~/.grdn), and allows you to organize them hierarchically. Seeds are AES-128 encrypted with a password (the same one for all seeds), and stored in a tree structure. This allows organization by purpose, location, application, wallet, or anything else you can think of. They can be nested as deeply as you want. This tool is not recommended for security-critical usecases. 

## Installation

    $ gem install grdn
